# Savor Cross Chain Yield Aggregator

This repo includes the contracts for the Savor Cross chain yield aggregaor being submitted for the Chainklink spring 22 hackathon.

Savor strives to be the first cross chain yield aggregator. With one deposit on any of the supported chain users are automatically earning the highest yields available across all supported chains.

## Setup

This repository is built using hardhat.

To Setup:
```
    1. Clone Repo on to your local device
    2. run "npm install"  to install dependencies
    3. Create an .env file and copy envexample in filling in the info for each variable
    4. Run "npx hardhat compile"
```
## Architecture

The master vault (SavorVault.sol) uses the ERC4626 token standard and is an adaptation of the Rari Capital vaults that can be found here. https://github.com/Rari-Capital/vaults.

The Bridgerton.sol contract utilizies the Stargate router to send funds between multiple chains.

The Strategies for each vault (StratExample.sol) are adapted from Yearn.Finance strategies used for their vaults.

## Tests

npx hardhat test
## Deploy

All contracts can be deployed through the pre-made npm commands to any supported network.

simply run the command in order of "contract:network:deploy"

EX: "npm run bridgerton:rinkeby:deploy" will deploy the bridgerton contract and verify the contract on etherscan if the etherscan key is provided in the .env

You can test the deployment tasks on a local fork by inserting localhost in the network spot while a fork of the desired chain is running on your local device at http://127.0.0.1:8545/.

All deployments are saved in deployments.json after deployed to be used in the other tasks.

---- deployments.txt is the officail addresses and should not be changed ----

Bridgerton contract should be deployed first followed by the Vault then any Strategies can be added

The deploy-strategy task will need to updated based on the constructor parameters for the strategy being deployed
